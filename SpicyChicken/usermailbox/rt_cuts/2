To Whom it may concern:

Tag 23841 was cut by 50 MW for HE 01 and HE 02.  Wally @ NEVP said he heard=
 of the cut @ 23:30 on 06/27/01 but he neglected to call us and tell us abo=
ut the cut.  The reason for the cut was PAC non-firm tranny being cut that =
PSCO bought.  However they sold us a firm product.  PNM didn't know about t=
he cut either until their reliability person told them they were pushing po=
wer on the grid (Approx. time of notification 01:20).  We booked out with P=
SCO and PNM for HE 01 and HE 02 on the 4C345 part of the transaction (deals=
 666385 and 666387).  For HE 03 25 MW was cut and we booked out with PSCO a=
nd PNM on the 4C345 piece of the transaction (deals 666385 and 666387).  PS=
CO resupplied the power for HE 03 from SRP @ Mead 230.   The same thing hap=
pened for HE 06 as HE 03.  SRP resupplied  the power for HE 06.  I bought b=
ack for HE 06 from PSCO @ 4C345 and resold the power to SRP.  The deals are=
 in the RT Inc. sheet for the 28th of June.  After the fact, I spoke with R=
yan @ PSCO and he agreed to be billed liquidated damages for HE 01 and HE 0=
2 on the MEAD 230 part of the transaction (06:00 on Kate Symes Phone).
