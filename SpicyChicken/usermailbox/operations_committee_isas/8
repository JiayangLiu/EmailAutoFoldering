Based on what I've seen so far, looks like June 27th.

Based on that, I have tentatively booked a room 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. at
the PDX Conference Center, Portland, OR.  If you haven't been there before,
there's diagram/map at:

Some of the items for an agenda:
*	Elimination of preschedule flag
*	Time table times refer to prevailing time of the sink/load control
area
*	Preschedule items
*	Real-time items

There are more specific items, I just haven't had enough coffee yet.  A real
agenda out next week.
