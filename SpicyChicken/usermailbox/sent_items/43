Stewart and Paul,

I have heard that MPC has contracted with Avista to do their load balancing. Has anyone contacted MPC to discuss continuing or renewing our relationship with them in the future. MPC is likely month-to-month with Avista as they were with us. Has there been any progress with EPE? What are your expectations for retaining them? Of all our service customers these would be the only two I am truly concerned about getting back. I think we have seen significant revenue from both, more because of the information they provide then because of the fee structures. Please let me know if you have any questions, or if there is anything I can do to assist.

Thanks,
Bill
