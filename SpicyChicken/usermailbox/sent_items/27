Jon,
Good to hear from you. Glad to hear you are healing up, as for me, I am still working on the sprained knee. Enough of this one game and out stuff. Do you know when the outdoor season starts? I am hoping to make some indoor games, but want to concentrate on outdoor.

Bill

Hi Guys,

Not sure who is in charge of the indoor team but I noticed we have our first
game of the upcoming season this Thursday night at 10:15 against FC Cosmos.
For more info go to

As for me my hamstring is slowly healing so I should be back out there
before too long.  Later.

Jon
