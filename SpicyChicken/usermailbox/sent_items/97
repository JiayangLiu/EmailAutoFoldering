Group,
We are long 20 mws in SDG1 for HE 2 and HE 3. We are long 10 mws in SDG1 for HE 4 and HE 5. This cost us $7.50. We imported it from MEAD 230.
We are also long 10 mws in NP-15 for HE 7-22 at $25. This is from Redding.

Finally, ST-SW has extra transmission from PV to 4C and PV to Mead. You can query by Enron Power Marketing on the APS site to see what we have already purchased. If you need this transmission off-peak please use what we have already purchased. We can go over the Enpower when I get in in the morning.

Thanks,

Bill
