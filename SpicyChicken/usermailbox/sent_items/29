Bill,

The DBAs for the EnPower database want to take it down from 4 PM Friday afternoon (6 PM Houston) to 4 PM Saturday afternoon (6PM Houston).  The reason for this is the NETCO/Estate database and hardware split that is occuring this weekend.  Let us know as soon as possible if this is ok or not so the DBA's can get their plan togethre for this weekend.  

thanks,

Susan Amador
