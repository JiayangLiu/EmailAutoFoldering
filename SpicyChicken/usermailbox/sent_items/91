Jill,
Could you look into my concur expense login/password. I am at a class today and need to approve these expense reports in the system. However,I cannot access the system. I am not sure if this is related to our floor wide network problems or what. Also, we are a go for Edgefield. You and I just need to talk about the expense report.

Thanks,

Bill
