All,
	Attached are two PDF files, one detailing why the CAISO is going to start assessing Grid Management charges to A/S self-provision, and one detailing the budget breakdown for 2002.  The good news is that their proposal to FERC is not as bad as the first one presented at the last Market Issues Forum, but the increases are still steep.  Page 10 of the budget attachment has a graph detailing the old and new rates.  All that is left is for FERC to approve it.  The proposed new rates for 2002 will be as follows: 

CC	Old Rate:	New Rate:	Percentage Increase:	
				
521	0.406	0.575	42.00%	
522	0.223	0.368	65.00%	
523	0.951	0.957	1.00%	


Please see the attached files for further details.  Let me know if you have any questions.
