Group,
The meeting this afternoon will be delayed until next week. I am waiting for more information on UBS. So, next Thursday at 4 PM we will have our meeting with the pizza.
Thanks,
Bill

If you are still entering deals into Enpower for Jan 24 going forward, please use EPMI-WEST-PERFORMANCE for the trading desk. This desk represents all deals where we are still meeting contract agreements or doing any pre pays etc.
