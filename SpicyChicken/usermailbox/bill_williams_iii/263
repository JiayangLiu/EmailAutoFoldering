Per EPE lending agreement  -

We'll be short 50 mw on peak at Palo - 25 mw under STWBOM, 25 mw under STSW - at a price of $49. Buy to fill this real time. Reduce El Paso purchase prices to $4. Sell back to El Paso at $0. Here are the day-ahead deals....

732687 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 25 mw @ $49

732692 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 25 mw @ $49

732696 - STSW buys EPE
	 25 mw @ $49

Also, STWBOM is short 25 mw on peak in SP15 at a day-ahead price of $44.27. (STCALI is short 100 mw off-peak, SP15, at day-ahead price of $31.02.)

Please enter all purchases using the same book name used in the day-ahead sale. If STCA is short, STCA needs to buy the energy to fill that. I am still running into errors regarding this procedure. Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate
