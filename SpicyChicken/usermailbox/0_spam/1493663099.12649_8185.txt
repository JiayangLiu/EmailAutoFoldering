(MSNBC News) Providence, RI - A leading neuroscientist from Brown University has uncovered a spectacular benefit of an everyday cooking oil.

He created a simple 4 course meal plan inspired by the diet of a 100% Alzheimer's-free Indian village. A meal plan, that when eaten daily, reversed even the most severe cases of dementia in about 21 days.

The discovery of this new "brain food", which has been shown to reverse memory loss and cure Alzheimer???s in less than 21 days, has left the medical community stunned.

47,187 Americans have already used this breakthrough method to enjoy dramatic improvements in their memory, focus and concentration, without a single drug.
