Hello Bill,

Just a reminder that we scheduled the test for Thursday May 3rd @ 1:00.
Just bring some clothes to test in, and we have places to change here.

Directions -

Go West on 26 to Murry Rd. Exit.
Take Murry to Walker Road and take a right.
The campus will be on your left.
Take a left at the first light (I think)
There will be an entrance with a waterfall along the side.
At the security bunker go right.
You will come up on a huge building on your left this is Mia Hamm building.
Park where ever you can find a spot.  There is a parking structure that
usually is a good spot to check.
Come into the Mia Hamm building and have the receptionist give me a call.

Let me know if you have any other questions.
Thanks,


Jason Meeker
